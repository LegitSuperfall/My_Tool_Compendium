#### Here is the list with no particular order:<br>
___
<br>

**[Blank.page](https://blank.page)** is just that. A simple blank page. It has spellcheck, markdown preview, and dark mode. Everything you write is stored locally and saved automatically. It even remembers what you had selected. You can add `/any_word_you_want` after the address to create a new page. I recommend having an index on one of them for all the other ones you create because there is no way of seeing which ones you created.<br>
I'm actually writing this text on a blank.page right now.<br>
It works very well when you tile it with vivaldi.<br>
Something that does bother me about it is that you can't grab the scrollbar. You have to use the mouse wheel. So **`Ctrl+Home`** and **`Ctrl+End`** are your friends here
<br><br>


**[Gyazo](https://gyazo.com/en)** is a simple screen snipper. You can do a normal screen grab, and you can create a gif ***from*** a screen grab.<br>
You can set hotkeys, but i just leave it on my taskbar. When you capture, it creates a link. You can set gyazo to automatically open it in your browser, or you can just paste the link anywhere. The gif does take a few seconds tbh. Im not sure why.
<br><br>


I use **[Anchorpoint](https://www.anchorpoint.app)** for version control. It's specifically made for games or anything that uses large files. It's free if you link it to GitHub.<br>
Please people. **I beg you**. Use version control. It's not that hard
<br><br>


**[Draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net)** is a free online diagram software for making flowcharts, and diagrams. You can also [download](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-desktop/releases/tag/v24.6.4) it.
<br><br>


**[PureRef](https://www.pureref.com/index.php)** is just an image board. Free for personal use, very lightweight, stupid easy to use. Just drag and drop images from anywhere.
<br><br>


I use **[Vivaldi](https://vivaldi.com)** as my browser. It's made by the original creator of Opera. It's very private because they collect pretty much no data. They don't have to do that since that's not how they make money.<br>
But who cares about privacy, what i want is a browser that doesn't use 5gigs while idling. That's my story with OperaGX. If i leave it on it will just keep using more and more ram, even if i'm not doing anything.<br>
Now, that's why i switched to Vivaldi, but the reason i actually like it is because of how goddamn customizable it is.

#### Some features i use include:

	- You can move/remove/add __every__ button on the browser (within reason lol).
	  This includes dropdown menus (when you right click on anything)
	  You can even add links to dropdown menus.

	- It has a few different ways of displaying the tabs like tab stacking. (I keep mine to the right)

	- You can create a web panel (sidebar applet) from (i think) every website.
	  I'm using discord through a web panel right now.

	- Some built in applets like a reading list, a notepad (you can right click on text to copy/paste notes),
	  email, calendar, and even a translator.

	- Tab tilling. Instead of having to open a different window and making both windows smaller,
	  you can just have both tabs open on the same window.

	- Create and share your browser themes

	- And the of course, the most important of all features: Instead of dinorun you have vivaldia 1 and 2.
	  They are full 2d sidescrollers.

I'll be honest, it isn't perfect.<br>
There are one or two things that really bother me. For example: you can force a dark mode on every page (it's great. i can't live without it) but it breaks some things. Some images don't look right, sometimes text isn't legible, etc. But that's is normal, Gx has the same problem. Vivaldi's dark mode actually works way better. But in gx you can rightclick anywhere and you have an option to disable it. In Vivaldi you have to open the settings.

Vivaldi isn't perfect, but it's my favorite.
<br><br>


#### This isn't an app or anything, but:<br>
On almost any browser you can press **`Shift+ESC`** to open **your browser's task manager**. It let's you see what recourses each process is using. You can terminate the ones that you don't want anymore. The tab's will remain open, but you have to reload them for them to work (sometimes you have to restart the browser for some reason)
<br><br><br>



**[Milanote](https://milanote.com)** is also sort of like a mood board like PureRef, but more fleshed out. You can draw, you can add text, lists, tables, columns, etc. You can organize with different boards, you can nest the boards, etc.<br>
It can even be viewed and edited by a whole team<br>
You can use 100 'cards' (images, lists, etc) for free, but you need a subscription after that. You can invite people, and each person you invite adds 20 to your maximum (up to 100 extra).<br>
(Please use [my invite](https://www.milanote.com/refer/rcEONdHa0eJ1JUwn8p) lol, i'm sitting at 94 cards)
<br><br>


**[Figma](https://www.figma.com/)** is a free and online drag and drop vector based design platform. It's kind of hard to explain what it is, you have to look for yourself. What i can say is that you can prototype entire apps with it. There are exporters that translate it into code i believe. I use it for designing my UI and also for a quick scheduler i made. (I can't find a calendar i like... I'm very visual so i need to see the entire day, every hour, how long everything takes, etc)
<br><br>


**[HacknPlan](https://hacknplan.com)** is an online project manager specifically made for game development. It has customizable boards split by technical category (programming, art, design, marketing, etc), activity logs, assign tasks to each team member, and it's easy to make a GDD in it.
<br><br>


**[Passwordgenerator](https://passwordsgenerator.net/)** is what you think it is. It generates passwords. You have a few settings like length, symbol usage, and you can generate the password locally.<br>
I personally don't know even one of my passwords. they are all 16char randomly generated passwords and this makes it really easy.
You can even make an applet with it in vivaldi.
<br><br>


I can not believe i'm not hearing much about E-on software's **[PlantFactory](https://youtu.be/BXhL4jlseNw?si=udCXMoR27pGLCRGt)** and **[Vue](https://youtu.be/WCCBRW2iU7M?si=kR9c4pNsVPQivy6N)**. You can [download them](https://www.bentley.com/software/e-on-software-free-downloads/) for free. PlantFactory is incredible if you want to make trees, bushes and things like that. Vue is a world generation tool.
It doesn't sound like a big deal until you have to place every single leaf in a branch in blender.
They were used by big companies like Warner Bros, Sony, and DreamWorks.
Sadly they've been discontinued, so no more updates or support. That's why it's free now, so thank you Bentley Systems. Watch __askNK's__ videos for a __very basic__ understanding of these tools. Watch [e-on software's tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/@eonsoftware/playlists) if you actually plan on using them.
<br><br>


You can use **[Ezgif](https://ezgif.com)** to edit... You guessed it, gifs. gif to video, gif resizer, optimizer, add effects and text, you can even create a gif from any set of images.
<br><br>


**[TinEye](https://tineye.com)** is an insanely fast reverse image search that helps you track down images for free. Think of googles image search, but much better. It has a few sorting options like best match, oldest, and most changed. It even finds the original version of edited images.
<br><br>


**[MyNoise](https://mynoise.net/noiseMachines.php)** is a soundscape/white noise generator. Each noise machine has 10 different sliders, each with their own sound. You can set it to animate and it will slowly move the sliders, which gives you a lot of variety over time.
I use it for background music when i'm working on my game. 
I like to use two at the same time. ***I recommend*** Quantum Polarity with Endless Horizons (lower the percs and taps to 0), or Polyrhythm Pattern Generator with Shroom with a View. Just set both to animate, lower the volume on both, and i'm set for the day.
It has about a hundred free sounds, and around 150 more if you throw the guy some coins. It has a lot more perks if you do too.
He also made **thewhitenoiseplaylist** which is just white noise.<br>
I will say that it does use an unreasonable amount of ram. It sits between 700mb and even 1.2 gigs on occasion.
<br><br>


**[LMMS](https://lmms.io)** is a digital audio workstation (DAW) application program. It allows music to be produced by arranging samples, synthesizing sounds, whatever, You get the idea. It's like flstudio or ableton. I've used all of those, but honestly LMMS is my favorite.<br>
Oh and guess what. [FL Studio](https://www.image-line.com/fl-studio/compare-editions/) is 100 bucks. 230 if you want to *record audio*. 530 if you want all the instruments and effects. [Ableton](https://www.ableton.com/en/shop/live/) is *only* 80 bucks or 600 for the full suite. You wanna guess how much LMMS costs? It's completely free. It's open source. And it works with linux (that's what the L stands for)<br>
I used to really like ableton... Until i got tired of making new emails for the free trial. I tried Lmms. And it's actually so much better.
<br><br>

You can use **[ToolsToday's text](https://toolsaday.com/text-tools/split-text)** to seperate your text into many parts. This is useful if you're writing something entirely too long for a discord message.
<br><br>

**[Markdown Viewer](https://markdownlivepreview.com)** let's you easily see what your markdown text will look like as you edit it in real time.
<br><br>


**[Discord](https://youtu.be/xvFZjo5PgG0)**<!--Gottem.--> is an instant messaging and social platform... Lmao
