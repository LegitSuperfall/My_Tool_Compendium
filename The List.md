I use **Anchorpoint** for version control. It's free if you link it to github. It's specifically made for games or anything that uses large files.


**Draw.io** is a free online diagram software for making flowcharts, and diagrams. You can also download it.


**PureRef** is just an image board. Free for personal use, very lightweight, stupid easy to use. Just drag and drop images from anywhere.


I can't believe i'm not hearing much about E-on software's **PlantFactory** and **Vue**. They are free now. PF is incredible if you want to make trees, bushes and things like that. Vue is a world generation too. They were used by big companies like Warner Bros, Sony, and DreamWorks
 Sadly they've been discontinued, so no more updates or support. That's why it's free now, so thank you Bentley Systems. Watch __askNK's__ videos for a __very basic__ understanding of these tools


I use **vivaldi** as my browser. It's incredibly private as they collect pretty much no data. (That's kind of why i switched away from OperaGX. That and how much ram gx uses. if i leave it on it just keeps using more and more ram, even if i'm just watching yt.) They don't have to do that because that's not how they make money. It's made by the original creator of Opera.
But the reason i like it is because of how goddamn customizable it is.

Features include:

	- You can move/remove/add __every__ button on the browser (within reason lol). This includes dropdown menus (when you right click on anything)

	- It has a few different ways of displaying the tabs like tab stacking.

	- You can create a web panel (sidebar applet) from (i think) every website. I'm using discord through a web panel right now.

	- Some built in apples like a reading list, a notepad (you can set it up so when right click on text, you can copy/past notes), email, calendar, and even a translator.

	- Tab tilling. Instead of having to open a different window and making both windows smaller, you can just have both tabs open on the same window.

	- Create and share your browser themes

	- And the most important of all: Instead of dinorun you have vivaldia 1 and 2. They're full 2d sidescrollers

I'll be honest, it isn't perfect. There are one or two things that really bother me. Like, you can force a dark mode on every page (it's great. i can't live without it) but it breaks some things. some images don't look right. Which is normal, Gx has the same thing, and vivaldi even works way better. But in gx you can rightclick anywhere and you have an option to disable it. in viv you have to open the settings.

It isn't perfect, but it's my favorite.


This isn't an app or anything, but on almost any browser you can press **Shift+ESC** to open your browser's task manager. It let's you see what recourses each process is using. You can terminate the ones that you don't want anymore. The tab's will remain open, but you have to reload them for them to work (sometimes you have to restart the browser for some reason)


**Blank.page** is just that. A simple blank page. It has spellcheck, markdown preview, and dark mode. Everything you write is stored locally and save automatically. You can add /any_word_you_want after the address to create a new page. I recommend having an index on one of them for all the other ones you create because there is no way of seeing which ones you created.
I'm actually writing this text on a blank.page right now.
It works very well when you tile it with vivaldi.
Something that bother's me about it is that you can't grab the scrollbar. You have to use the mouse wheel. So __Ctrl+Home__ and __Ctrl+End__ are your friends here


**Milanote** is also sort of like a mood board like PureRef, but more fleshed out. You can draw, you can add text, lists, tables, columns, etc. You can organize with different boards, you can nest the boards, etc.
You can use 100 'cards' (images, lists, etc) for free, but you have to get a subscription after that. Each person you invite adds 20 to your maximum (up to 100 extra). (please use mine lol: https://www.milanote.com/refer/rcEONdHa0eJ1JUwn8p)


**Figma** is a vector based design platform, mostly for UI. It's also free and online. You can prototype entire apps with it. There are exporters that translate it into code i believe. I use it for designing my UI and also for a quick scheduler i made. (I can't find a calendar i like... I'm very visual so i need to see the entire day, every hour, how long everything takes, etc)


**HacknPlan** is an online project manager specifically made for game development. It has customizable boards split by technical category (programming, art, design, marketing, etc), activity logs, assign tasks to each team member, and it's easy to make a GDD in it.


**passwordgenerator.net** is what you think it is. I personally don't know even one of my passwords. they are all 16char randomly generated passwords and this makes it really easy. It has some simple settings, and you can even make an applet with it in vivaldi.


**Gyazo** is a simple screen snipper. It has a normal screen grab, and a __gif screen grab__. You can set hotkeys, but i just leave it on my taskbar. When you capture, it creates a link. You can set gyazo to automatically open it in your browser, or you can just paste the link anywhere. The gif does take a few seconds tbh. Im not sure why.


You can use **ezgif** to edit... You guessed it, gifs. gif to video, gif resizer, optimizer, add effects and text, you can even create a gif from any set of images.


**mynoise.net** is a soundscape/white noise generator. Each noise machine has 10 different sliders, each with their own sound. You can set it to animate and it will slowly move the sliders, which gives you a lot of variety over time.
I use it for background music when i'm working on my game. 
I like to use two at the same time. I __recommend__ Endless Horizons  (lower the percs and taps to 0) with Quantum Polarity, or Polyrhythm Pattern Generator with Shroom with a View. Just set both to animate, lower the volume on both, and i'm set for the day.
It has about a hundred free sounds, and around 150 more if you throw the guy some coins. It has a lot more perks if you do too.
He also made **thewhitenoiseplaylist** which is just white noise.


You can use **toolsaday.com/text-tools/split-text** to seperate your text into many parts. I totaly never really used it for anything lol


**Discord** is an instant messaging and social platform... Lmao
