I have ~~a few~~ ~~a lot~~ __an absolute shit ton__ of things i use all the time.
All of these have been personally vetted by me. I swear by them. I use them every day.
I will keep adding to this list as i remember things or find new ones.
I'm sorry if it's too big. I'm sure no one minds the size.

This list... It got a bit out of hand. I just kept adding to it...
I've been writing this for__**~~two hours~~ FIVE HOURS**__.
It got so big I had to separate it into six parts just to post it on Discord. I really hope i didn't waste my time here

I'm aware this list doesn't read well. It's really bland and it doesn't flow.
However, i encourage you to at least skim through it. There is a lot of cool stuff in there.

Please don't hesitate to reach out if you need more information about any of the things I mentioned.

I would really appreciate any suggestions. If something isn't clear, needs an update, or you want me to add something, please let me know.
